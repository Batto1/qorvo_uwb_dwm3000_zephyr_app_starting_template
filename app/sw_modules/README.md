## Brief
Software modules are referred as some code with different individual functionality that don't depend on and not specificly written for an application (i.e. libraries). These software modules also can be to compiler and Zephyr related code. 

## Portability of Code
These code implement software modules with different individual functionality that don't depend on and not specific to an application, thus it's portable between Zephyr applications. Compiler related modules can be portable between applications with same compiler and non-Zephyr modules can be portable between non-Zephyr applications.

## Parent Folder Name
sw_modules

## Properties Of The Parent Folder 
The parent folder should contain this README file, some software (SW) module files related with algorithms, and functionality that don't depend on and not specific to an application, and any other necessary and related files. Files should be appropriately categorized and foldered as required.
