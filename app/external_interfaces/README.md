## Brief
"External interfaces" are defined as interfaces between other defined parts of a larger system that the application is a part of, if there exist such system. For example, interface can be a messaging protocol, format of how a command is composed or some kind of arrangement of electrical signal transferred to or received from the application between a server, a ground station, a satellite, a device or even a human etc. Files for defining and implementing interfaces are kept here.

## Portability of Code
If same interfaces are to be used, code will be portable. 

## Parent Folder Name
external_interfaces

## Properties Of The Parent Folder 
The parent folder should contain this README file, some software (SW) files related with interfacing between other defined parts of a larger system, and any other necessary and related files. Files should be appropriately categorized and foldered as required.

## Note
If the application itself is the largest system or doesn't have any interface, then this README file and the parent folder that contains it can be deleted since they won't be necessary.
